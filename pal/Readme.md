# PAL images
There are three files for each image:
- the original .jed dumps of the PALs
- .GDJ automatic conversion to the GAL variant, where available
- .EQN decompilation

If you have a PAL-capable programmer and actual PAL chips, you're home free with nothing to worry about.
If you don't, you can find GALs for most of the chips and burn them with commodity programmers like TL866. In that case you'd be using the GDJ alternative.
The PAL8L14A (1589-01) at U312 is very hard to find, see the main page README for alternatives.
Similarly the GAL20XV10 alternative for the PAL20X10A (1595-01) at U107 is not burnable with mainstream programmers.
