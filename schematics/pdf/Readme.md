# Schematics

There are a few original schematics available - one is more readable but a previous version and lacks some signal annotations and connections, and this version which is lesser quality but complete.
The incomplete version also helps in many cases where the signal names on the more complete version are unreadable.
You can tell you have the incomplete version if the schematics have the framing and standard schematic information in the bottom-right.

The other schematic is exported out of Kicad.
